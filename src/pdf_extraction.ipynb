inﬁnite programming    \f   introduction  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  dynamic pricing is a business strategy concerned with periodically adjusting the prices of products  to reﬂect changes in circumstances in an environment where customers are price sensitive and with  aim to maximize long term proﬁtability common events that justify an adjustment in selling price  of a product include changes in market conditions increase or depletion of inventory or resources  supply availability modiﬁcations in customer demand behavior due to eg the selling season  the introduction of complement products or increase in knowledge about the demand response  dynamic pricing policies have been long employed in the travel hospitality and energy sectors  where short term capacity is rigid to mitigate imbalances in supply and demand the main reason  for the early adoption of dynamic pricing strategies in these industries was the ability to change  prices at low cost and in a centralized fashion elmaghraby and keskinocak  in contrast  in industries with more ﬂexible supply such as retail imbalances between supply and demand  have traditionally been moderated by means of dynamic inventory control while active inventory  management is a useful tool for increasing proﬁt it only serves to decrease costs dynamic pricing  on the other hand provides a means for also aﬀecting revenues provided the population to which the  product is oﬀered is price sensitive unfortunately high menu costs precluded such industries from  regularly adjusting their prices the emergence of the internet as a sales channel and the increasing  use of digital price tags have drastically decreased such costs while technological advances are by  and large permitting the automation of price changes dynamic pricing is thus becoming ubiquitous  across most industries enabling retailers to leverage on both sides of the proﬁt equation  in this paper we focus on a variant of the dynamic pricing problem often referred to as the  tactical pricing problem whereby a ﬁrm is endowed with a ﬁnite inventory of a single product  available for sale thus our methodology is adequate for products with rigid capacity short life   cycle relative to their procurement lead time eg holiday goods fashion apparel products  produced oversees or for products at the end of their life cycle we discuss how our framework  extends to the dynamic pricing problem with inventory control the multi product pricing problem  with ﬁnite inventories and the network revenue management problem among others  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    the need for modeling demand as an uncertain parameter was recognized very early mills   nevertheless a critical assumption made by most academic studies incorporating uncer   tainty is that the demand curve or demand function which maps prices to expected demand is  completely known by the ﬁrm while it has the beneﬁt of reducing the computational complexity  of the underlying problems since the only source of uncertainty is that in the residual demand   this assumption of full information is unrealistic in most practical settings indeed knowledge  of the characteristics of customer behavior for any given product is typically incomplete or even  lacking altogether this is enhanced by the fact that over the last decades product life cycles  have decreased elmaghraby and keskinocak  while new products constantly emerge in the  markets thus it is natural to assume that the demand curve is unknown  when the demand curve is unknown the ﬁrm is faced with the trade oﬀ between exploitation  pricing to maximize revenue and exploration demand learning on the one hand exploiting  available information increases short term proﬁtability on the other hand it may lead to high  opportunity costs in the long run indeed in the context of revenue management demand learning  occurs as a byproduct of pricing thus in order to build an accurate model for the demand curve  a retailer must experiment with diﬀerent prices invariably deviating from the myopic pricing  strategy which is optimal based on current information rothshield  and mclennan   were the ﬁrst to highlight the possibility of incomplete learning in dynamic pricing building upon  the theory of multi armed bandits originally proposed by robbins  recognizing that pricing  patterns impact their ability to learn the demand curve retailers increasingly proceed with price  experimentation while frequent price changes may damage the reputation of a ﬁrm they may  prove crucial in determining the asymptotically optimal selling prices of products  beyond the computational complexities associated with the determination of a pricing strategy  that optimally balances between learning and earning even the exploitation of information asso   ciated with a simple myopic strategy requires data historically this has hampered all but the  most technologically advanced ﬁrms that had the ability to gather store and analyze such data  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  sets from learning customer behavior in recent years acknowledging that data can help them  take more informed decisions and facilitated by a reduction in the costs of information technology  and the increased use of electronic transactions most ﬁrms have started accumulating sales data  thus it is believed that in the coming years most retailers will have the ability to dynamically  adjust their prices at low cost and integrating the latest data in their decision taking  in this context ﬁrms are thus faced with two questions  a how to build an accurate model of demand curve uncertainty from the available data  b given this model how to determine compute a pricing strategy that optimally balances  between exploitation and exploration  in this paper we address both these questions in a uniﬁed fashion   literature review  dynamic pricing in an uncertain environment has received considerable attention by researchers in  numerous areas ranging from operations research and management science to economics computer  science and control the focal point of this review is the recent literature on dynamic pricing with  learning in a parametric stationary monopolist environment we also brieﬂy discuss the literature  on robust dynamic pricing for a survey of the research on dynamic pricing without learning we  refer the interested reader to the books by talluri and van ryzin  and phillips  and  the review papers by bitran and caldentey  and elmaghraby and keskinocak   parametric models with bayesian learning the leading line of research on dynamic pricing  takes a bayesian approach thus a parametric model of the demand is postulated jointly with  a prior distribution that reﬂects the seller’s initial knowledge of the model parameters demand  observations are used to update the prior into a posterior through the application of bayes’ rule  the vast majority of studies cast in this framework assume that customers arrive according  to a homogeneous poisson process with unknown rate which can be partially resolved through  judicious pricing and purchase the product with a known price dependent probability directly  associated with their willingness to pay see aviv and pazgal  lin  araman and  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    caldentey  farias and van roy  others assume that one of a ﬁnite number of models  is known to apply see harrison et al  the probability associated with the validity of each  model is then updated with additional sales observations unfortunately these formulations do not  generally admit an analytic solution and problems of realistic size are computationally intractable  thus researchers have resorted to the design and analysis of heuristics with attractive theoretical  properties for example aviv and pazgal  propose a certainty equivalent heuristic araman  and caldentey  propose a greedy pricing heuristic farias and van roy  propose a  decay balancing heuristic while harrison et al  propose variants of myopic policies  a common criticism of the bayesian modeling paradigm is that in order to obtain a posterior  of the same form as the prior the prior distribution is artiﬁcially constrained to belong to a class  of distributions conjugate to the demand process thus reducing modeling ﬂexibility  parametric models and learning with classical estimation a related line of research proposes to  model the demand curve as a ﬁxed parametric function of the price whose parameters are unknown  to the seller and inference is made by eg least squares or maximum likelihood estimation in  this context the optimal pricing strategy can in principle be computed by dynamic programming  following the principles of dual control theory see eg feldbaum  unfortunately this  methodology suﬀers from the curse of dimensionality while no closed form solutions are available  thus several researchers have resorted to approximations lobo and boyd  approximate  the value function in the dynamic program by linearizing the inverse of the covariance matrix of  the unknown parameters around the myopically optimal policy with “dithering” carvalho and  puterman   propose a one step look ahead policy which at each step chooses the  price that approximately maximizes the sum of the revenues in the next two periods bertsimas  and perakis  reduce the state space of the dynamic program by relying on the principles of  least squares estimation and show that their methodology extends to competitive environments  others construct suboptimal policies that are shown to have desirable theoretical properties  besbes and zeevi  develop a parametric pricing policy based on maximum likelihood esti   mation establish lower bounds on the regret of any policy and show that their policies are close to  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  this lower bound broder and rusmevichientong  propose maximum likelihood based policies  that cycle between explicit price experimentation and myopically optimal pricing policies harri   son et al  develop variants of a greedy iterated least squares policies which are shown to  be asymptotically optimal den boer  proposes a variant of a certainty equivalent pricing  strategy and demonstrates that this policy yields convergence of the parameter estimates to their  true values den boer  and den boer and zwart  enhance the certainty equivalent  pricing policy with a “taboo interval” around the average of previously chosen prices and show  that with this type of policy the value of the optimal price will be learned  robust approaches several authors have proposed to apply the robust optimization paradigm  whereby the uncertain parameters are assumed to lie in an uncertainty set see ben tal et al   and bertsimas et al  to the dynamic pricing problem the vast majority of this  research stream assumes that the demand model is perfectly known see eg thiele    lobel and perakis  or time varying and sequentially revealed at each stage see eg adida  and perakis   thus there is no opportunity for learning a related line of study takes  the distributionally robust approach in this setting the seller is immunized against multiple priors  in the neighborhood of a given distribution see eg lim and shanthikumar  and lim et al   while these latter formulations incorporate model uncertainty they do not capture the  learning ability of the retailer and may thus result in overly conservative solutions an exception in  this line of research is the paper by eren and maglaras  which assumes that demand is noise   free so that the model will become fully known if the ﬁrm experiments with all feasible price points  for a more in depth review of the literature on dynamic pricing with learning we refer to the  recent paper by den boer    proposed approach and contributions  the goal of this paper is to present a data driven and distribution free paradigm for demand  learning in dynamic pricing we postulate a parametric form for the demand curve but do not  assume that the residual demand comes from a speciﬁc distribution nor that this distribution is  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    known to the retailer instead we take the robust optimization view point and merely require  that the residual demand be norm bounded this modeling paradigm enables us to construct  a meaningful prior uncertainty set for the demand curve parameters with even few historical  data points we show that this set can naturally be updated into a posterior uncertainty set  which progressively “shrinks” around the true demand curve parameters as more price demand  pairs are observed in particular all of the sets constructed are guaranteed to contain the true  parameters while prior and posterior uncertainty sets are of the same form an attractive feature  as far as tractability is concerned in order to capture the ability of the retailer to learn the  posterior uncertainty sets we model his pricing decisions as functions of the history of observations  similarly we capture his ability to explore the set of demand curve parameters by allowing the  set of price demand pairs to depend on the pricing policy selected this construction enables us  to unify optimization and dynamic estimation the resulting dynamic pricing problem is an  adaptive optimization problem with policy dependent uncertainty set we propose a hierarchy of  approximation schemes inspired from techniques commonly used in robust optimization which  results in a practically tractable formulation  the main results and contributions of this paper are summarized below   we propose a novel data driven distribution free paradigm for dynamic learning that uni   ﬁes optimization and estimation we use techniques inspired from system identiﬁcation to  construct data driven uncertainty sets that learn the unknown parameters online during opti   mization and compute adaptive policies that exploit the information acquired in real time   our methodological contributions are twofold  a from a modeling perspective we propose to capture the ability of the retailer to explore  the characteristics of customer behavior by allowing the uncertainty set to depend on the  pricing decisions we model his capacity to exploit the information dynamically acquired  by letting the pricing decisions adapt to the history of observations these modeling  features result in an adaptive optimization problem with policy dependent uncertainty  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  set to the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst model of this type proposed in the  literature it naturally captures the trade oﬀ between exploration and exploitation  b from a solution standpoint we propose a hierarchical inner approximation scheme for  adaptive optimization with policy dependent uncertainty set we demonstrate that under  this approximation the dynamic pricing problem is equivalent to a mixed binary conic  problem that is practically tractable moreover we suggest numerous strategies that mit   igate the loss of optimality of the approximation at low computational overhead to the  best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst solution approach proposed for this problem type   we provide computational evidence that shows that the proposed policies a yield higher  proﬁts at modest computational expense compared to commonly used pricing strategies and  b perform nearly as well as perfect information policies with respect to downside measures  such as the conditional value at risk   we discuss numerous variants and extensions of the basic model that incorporate multiple  products and inventory decisions thus illustrating the versatility of the method we emphasize  that both our proposed modeling paradigm and solution approach remain applicable outside  the realm of dynamic pricing  the paper is organized as follows the remainder of this section introduces the notation while  section  describes the pricing problem the data and the demand model under consideration the  mathematical formulation of the problem is provided in section  section  gives insights into the  structure of the optimal pricing policies and the proposed solution approach is detailed in section   section  describes numerous extensions to the pricing problem to which our solution paradigm  remains applicable while heuristic approaches commonly employed in practice are described in  section  finally section  reports on numerical results  notation throughout this paper vectors

driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted     problem description historical data and demand dynamics  in this section we describe the pricing problem that will be the central focus of the paper the  demand model that will prevail in our exposition and the mild assumptions on the historical data   the tactical pricing problem  we consider the pricing problem faced by a ﬁrm henceforth referred to as the seller oﬀering a  single product over the ﬁnite planning horizon t       t  in an environment where customers  are price sensitive the seller is endowed with a ﬁxed ﬁnite inventory capacity c of the product  at the beginning of each period t ∈ t  he must choose a price pt ∈ l u   l ≤ u  ∞ for his  product we refer to l ut as the feasible price set at the end of period t the seller observes the  price sensitive demand dt generated during period t and resulting in a revenue dtpt cumulative  demand generated during the planning horizon is allowed to exceed capacity at a cost b ∈ r per  unit of the product often termed backlogging or backorder cost in the inventory management  literature any inventory remaining at the end of the horizon must be held on the premises at  cost h ∈ r per unit of the product this is usually referred to as holding cost thus for a given  price sequence and ensuing demand realization the proﬁt function of the seller is expressible as    t∈t              t∈t    t∈t  dtpt − max  h  c −  dt   b  dt − c      we remark that the requirement for the stage wise feasible price sets l u to be constant over the  planning horizon is non restrictive and is merely introduced in order to simplify notation in fact  our approach remains applicable in the case when the vector of prices      pt  is restricted to  lie in a polyhedral set possibly intersected with a discrete set in particular we are able to model  mark up  ≥ pt mark down  ≤ pt and absolute deviation  − pt ≤  constraints that  commonly arise in practice   demand dynamics and historical data  we assume that at the beginning of the planning horizon the seller has at his disposal h price   demand pair realizations these may correspond to historical observations the results of a market  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  survey etc for notational convenience and independently of how they were generated we index  these observations by non positive time t ∈ h  −h        thus viewing them as successive  historical realizations  we assume that the demand for the product at time t ∈ t  h ∪ t is given by a ﬁxed function  of the price pt for that period corrupted by an additive error term we refer to t as the selling  horizon nuance with the planning horizon t  we focus on linear demand functions of the form  dt    pt   ∀t ∈ t       thus observed demand is the sum of two parts a deterministic price dependent part   pt  and a random component  inspired from robust optimization we assume that no statistical  knowledge of  t ∈ t  is available and postulate that   ∈t is norm bounded by a known  constant  ∈  ∞ ie   ≤   for some p ∈   ∞ the intercept  ∈ r and slope  ∈ r of the demand function in   hereafter referred to as parameters of the demand curve are chosen by “nature” when the product  is devised throughout the selling horizon  and  will likely remain unknown to the seller  implying that the residual demand  ∈ r t ∈ t  will be unobservable the seller will nevertheless  be able to gain information learn about  and  as a byproduct of his pricing decisions  we now formalize our assumptions regarding the model and the data   the postulated model   is valid over the feasible price set with p and  known   the set   ∈    −  − ptt∈ ≤  is bounded and has non empty interior  ie there exist   ∈  and    such that  −  − ∈ ≤  −   several comments are in order first the restriction to linear demand curves may seem stringent  indeed the demand curve for virtually any product is generally nonlinear converging to zero for  large price values does not take on negative values and results in revenue functions   ptpt  spanning r see eg talluri and van ryzin  nevertheless in the context of the pricing  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    problem set forth above most ﬁrms typically only allow their prices to vary in a moderately sized  interval constructed by taking into account competition production costs etc over which the  demand curve can be well approximated by a linear function as we are only concerned with the  behavior of the demand function over this interval we argue that a linear demand model is in fact  adequate we note that linear demand models are extremely popular in the revenue management  literature due to their simplicity see eg mas colell et al  and talluri and van ryzin   we emphasize that by “model validity” in assumption  we do not necessarily mean that  the model is actually linear with norm bounded uncertainty but rather that no data will be seen  during the selling season which invalidates the model assumption  implies that the set from  assumption  is non empty second the choice of norm p should be guided both by the data  if suﬃcient samples are available and the knowledge of the seller acquired from similar products  as a guideline we would recommend using a  norm for residual errors that resemble a truncated  normal and an ∞ norm in other cases third we note that obtaining an accurate bound  may be  challenging when little data is available nevertheless we believe that it is easier to select a suitable  value for  rather than to estimate an entire distribution for the behavior of  we note that a large  value of  will always guarantee the validity of the model but may slow down learning finally we  argue that the requirement that the set in assumption  is bounded is non restrictive since  prices are under the control of the seller it can always be enforced by experimenting with at least  two distinct prices prior to the beginning of the planning horizon we note that if this set has  empty interior the seller knows the demand curve precisely and there is no need for exploration  remark  prior information the model discussed above readily extends to the case when  the seller has prior data independent information on the possible set of values prior ⊆  taken  on by   with prior a pth order cone representable set see eg ben tal et al  for a  deﬁnition in such a case it suﬃces to augment the postulated model in assumption  with  the requirement that   ∈ prior and relax assumption  to require that the set   ∈  prior    −  − ptt∈ ≤  be compact thus if prior is compact no historical data is  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  needed prior information generally available to the seller includes knowledge of the signs of the  demand curve parameters eg    andor  ≤   remark  extensions the pricing problem discussed in this section may seem deceptively  simple however it possesses all the features necessary for us to describe our approach we empha   size that our methodology remains applicable for a far broader class of pricing problems including  the classical newsvendor with pricing problem and the multi product revenue management prob   lem where demand may depend on current and even past prices of all products sold it also naturally  extends to the case of strategic customers and to a setting where the demand curve is time varying  this is in sharp contrast to other dynamic pricing approaches which are tailored to a speciﬁc  problem class moreover we note that the restriction to linear curves can be lifted an overview  of these and other variants and extensions is provided in section    pricing policies set estimation and problem formulation  in the previous section we described the problem faced by the seller the demand dynamics and  data available in this section we formalize the distribution free dynamic pricing problem mathe   matically as an adaptive optimization problem with decision dependent uncertainty set   information vector and pricing policies  the price for the product at time t ∈ t is selected at the beginning of period t after the history  p  d t−    of price demand pairs has been observed but before future outcomes p  d  ≥t become  available in order to capture the ability of the retailer to exploit the information available at each  stage we model his pricing decisions as functions of the history of observations and refer to this  sequence of functional variables as a pricing policy formally a pricing policy corresponds to a  non anticipative sequence        t  where each t t ∈ t  is a measurable function from  − to l u that maps historical observations to admissible prices we henceforth denote by t  the pricing policy for time t and by pt the price realization ie  pt        pt− dt− ∀t ∈ t   \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    we remark that since data prior to t   is known the pricing policy  is in fact a constant we  deﬁne the set  n   l −    t∈t  that corresponds to all non anticipative pricing policies taking values in l ut   remark  classical adaptive optimization in classical adaptive optimization see eg  ben tal et al  and bertsimas et al  the decisions are modeled as functions of the  primitive exogenous uncertainties in the problem this is either possible because these exogenous  uncertainties are directly observable ben tal et al  or made possible by the so called  “puriﬁed output” approach ben tal et al  this latter methodology infers the informa   tion generated by the primitive uncertainties from an observable output that depends linearly on  the controls and the uncertainties in the context of the dynamic pricing problem under consider   ation the residual demand primitive uncertainty is not observable and cannot be inferred from  the observed demand since  and  are unknown this will prevent us from following classical  adaptive optimization approaches for solving the dynamic pricing problem with demand learning  we now describe a methodology for constructing data driven uncertainty sets for dynamic pricing  that adapt to the pricing decisions thus enabling the seller to explore the demand curve   data driven adaptive set estimation  set estimation for the demand curve parameters the model of uncertainty introduced in sec   tion  does not assume any statistical knowledge of the error under these circumstances it is  natural to deﬁne a set of possible demand curve parameters we propose to construct this prior  uncertainty set as the union of all estimates   ∈  that are compatible with the model and  unfalsiﬁed by the historical data this set has maximal “size” when residual errors for the future  t ≥  are restricted to be equally zero and is representable as      ∈   dt    pt   ∀t ∈ h ∈ ≤      \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  we emphasize that dt and pt in the representation  are historical data points ie ﬁxed values  the set  thus corresponds to the set of all estimates for   that are not invalidated from  the historical data pt dtt∈h and the noise bound  we now present two examples of data driven  uncertainty set constructions and discuss their relationships to the popular least squares estimate  example  euclidean norm bound error when p   the set in  is representable as a  single ellipsoid        ∈

t∈h pt    t∈h   t       has full rank and is thus invertible the center and semi axes of this ellipsoid coincide with those  of the ellipsoid arising as a conﬁdence region from least squares

not necessarily lie in this set a  concrete example of such data driven uncertainty set is shown on figure   adaptive set estimation for the price demand realizations in the absence of statistical assump   tions on the residual error we set out to construct a set of possible price demand realizations for  the entire planning horizon as the demand at each stage t ∈ t is an unknown function of the price  which itself depends on historical observations this uncertainty set is naturally policy dependent  to the best of our knowledge uncertainty sets of this type have not previously appeared

uncertainty set by pruning out “on the ﬂy” regions  that are not compatible with would falsify the observations it is thus apparent that by allowing  the uncertainty set to adapt to the pricing decisions we precisely capture the learning ability of the  decision maker we note that modeling exploration adaptive uncertainty set is only pertinent if  we also model exploitation adaptive decision variables see section  if the seller cannot exploit  the information dynamically acquired there can be no beneﬁt in exploring  from the representation  we observe that for a ﬁxed pricing policy  the

observing  the price demand realization up to the end of stage t −  the retailer can fully characterize the pos   terior uncertainty set we note that similarly to the prior uncertainty set the

uncertainty sets for the demand curve parameters is identical to the set  membership estimators originally proposed in the late  by schweppe  and witsenhausen   in the systems identiﬁcation literature

also discussed that his exploitation capacity can  be captured by allowing the decisions to adapt to the history of observations in this section we  formulate mathematically the problem faced by the seller and show that it intrinsically captures  the trade oﬀ between exploration and exploitation  since the seller has no statistical knowledge on the residual demand distribution but only deter   ministic bounded norm information it is natural that he be immunized against all possible  realizations of the price demand pairs in the uncertainty set  we recall that this set corresponds  to all possible price demand realizations given demand curve parameters compliant with the data  and a chosen price policy thus the objective of the seller is to maximize the proﬁt function   in the worst case realization of p d       pt       dt  in the policy dependent set u  in mathematical terms we write  maximize ∈n  inﬁmum pd∈u    − max   −   b  −    dp  problem dp inherently captures the trade oﬀ between exploration and exploitation on the  one hand by choosing a pricing policy that maximizes his immediate revenue based on available  knowledge the seller may not adequately prune out regions of the membership set u thus  incurring large opportunity losses in the future on the other hand by choosing prices with sole  aim to explore the membership set signiﬁcant short term revenue losses may ensue that are not  counterbalanced by the possibility of future income note that the optimal objective value of dp  corresponds to the guaranteed proﬁt of the seller   insights when does the seller beneﬁt from exploration  in section  we proposed a mathematical formulation for the distribution free dynamic pricing  problem that incorporates learning of the unknown demand curve parameters in this section we  characterize cases when the seller does not beneﬁt from exploration and show that in the general  setting learning is in fact beneﬁcial for this purpose we introduce the following deﬁnition  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    definition  static pricing policy a pricing policy         t  ∈ n is called static  if it satisﬁes        − −  t˜ ˜     ˜pt− ˜dt−  for all       − − and ˜ ˜     ˜pt− ˜dt− in − and for each t ∈ t   from the formulation dp it becomes apparent that exploration demand learning is beneﬁcial  improves the objective value of dp if and only if there does not exist a static pricing strategy  that is optimal in dp indeed if there exists a static pricing strategy that is optimal in dp  exploring regions of the uncertainty set cannot help improve the objective value of dp since there  is no beneﬁt in exploiting that information through adaptation on the other hand if there does  not exist an optimal static pricing strategy for dp this implies that pruning out regions of the  uncertainty set that are incompatible with additional observations is necessary to improve the  objective of dp so that exploration is imperative  remark  pareto efficiency the existence of an optimal static pricing strategy for dp  does not necessarily mean that there may not be an adaptive pricing strategy that performs better  when scenarios other than the worst case ones materialize this is closely related to the idea of  pareto eﬃciency in classical robust optimization see iancu and trichakis  neither does it  imply that there may not be an adaptive pricing strategy that more eﬃciently prunes out critical  regions of the uncertainty set it only implies that in order to achieve the highest proﬁt in the  worst case realization of the uncertain parameters there is no need to explore the uncertainty set  we are now ready to investigate instances of problem dp for which exploration is not beneﬁcial   a case when there is no beneﬁt in exploration  the following proposition shows that when h  b   revenue maximization problem the seller  does not beneﬁt from exploration a proof is provided in the electronic companion   \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  proposition  no beneﬁt in exploration when h  b   suppose that the holding and  backlogging

problem   in general exploration is beneﬁcial  in the previous section we characterized instances of dp when exploration is not beneﬁcial we  now show that in the general setting the seller can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from demand learning a  proof of the statement is provided in the electronic companion   proposition  in general exploration is beneﬁcial if the holding and overbooking costs  are

proposed a novel data driven and distribution free modeling paradigm  for demand learning in dynamic pricing that uniﬁes optimization and estimation the resulting  dynamic pricing problem dp constitutes an adaptive generalized semi inﬁnite optimization problem  that is severely computationally intractable first it possesses a large number of time periods  indeed despite a persistent reduction of product life cycles most products still have shelf lives  spanning several months with pricing decisions taken daily second it optimizes over functional  decisions finally it possesses once expressed in epigraph form an inﬁnite number of constraints  enforced over decision dependent sets in section  we demonstrated that exploration is generally  imperative implying that it is necessary for the seller to optimize over adaptive policies in this  section we propose two successive approximations that reduce the sizes of the information and  decision spaces while preserving the ability of the seller to adapt and show that the resulting  problem can be formulated as a mixed binary conic program  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted     approximations  stage aggregation problem dp presents a large number of time periods translating to a large  number of observable uncertain parameters as a ﬁrst step to achieve computational tractability  we propose to reduce the information space in the problem by drastically decreasing the number  of observable uncertainties to mitigate the loss of optimality incurred by this approximation we  will judiciously construct a new vector of observable uncertainties as a function of the primitive  uncertainties       pt  dt  that accurately summarizes the information dynamically acquired  concretely speaking we propose to aggregate the time periods in the problem henceforth  referred to as micro periods to fewer macro periods we denote the set of macro periods by m        m  and let tm denote the set of all micro periods in macro period m ∈ m we require  that each tm consists of consecutive time periods and ∪m∈mtm  t  we let bm  mint∈tm t and  em  maxt∈tm t denote the ﬁrst and last micro periods in macro period m respectively we deﬁne  t m  ∪m   and t  m   h ∪ t m we assume that the price demand pairs pt dt are no longer  observed within each micro period t ∈ t  instead we only observe at the beginning of macro period  m ∈ m certain functions of the history of observations pt dtt∈t  m− that concisely summarize the  state of the retailer’s knowledge we denote these observable uncertainties by m ∈ rn and require  that they be the unique solutions to a system of equations of the form  rmpm  wmpd  rmp  for some matrices rmp ∈ rn×n  wmp ∈ rn×t and rmp ∈ rn  we refer to m as the reduced  information vector for macro period m in order to ensure that m be observable at the beginning  of macro period m we require that rmp be invertible for all p ∈ l ut  that wmp have non   zero entries in the ﬁrst em− columns only and that rmp wmp and rmp all be constant in  the prices pbm     pt  finally we require that rmp and wmp be quadratic separable in their  arguments thus being expressible as  rmp  rm     mtpt      t  wmp  wm   w   mtpt  w     t  em−     em−     \f  and  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  rmp

this last assumption and let rmp  wmp and rmp be polynomial not necessarily separable in they arguments as this assumption  does not inﬂuence the further derivations and simpliﬁes notation we enforce it here  example  least squares estimates and cumulative demand a natural choice for m  is to let   denote the least square estimates for   as of the end of the last micro period  in macro period m −  and deﬁne  as the cumulative demand incurred up until then thus  m     solves the system of equations           m−     t  m− pt     t∈t    m− dt  t∈t    m− pt  t∈t    m−   t   t∈t        m−

this  deﬁnition of m thus satisﬁes all of the observability requirements  remark  impact of the reduction in information space by observing the reduced  information vector at the beginning of each macro period rather than observing the new price   demand realizations each time they are made available the seller can eﬀectively only compute an  outer approximation to the true posterior uncertainty set this posterior uncertainty set is only  updated inside the optimization at the beginning of each macro period rather that at each stage  there is no incentive to change pricing strategy when no new information is revealed we thus  propose to adaptively select at the beginning of each macro period one of ﬁnitely many candidate  pricing strategies  ∈ k       k each of which takes on the value t ∈ l u at time t ∈  t  the pricing strategy selected at the beginning of macro period m ∈ m prevails throughout  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    the macro period concretely we introduce for each m ∈ m an adaptive vector of coeﬃcients  zm whose th element is  if and only if the th strategy is selected at the beginning of macro   period m we model zm as a non anticipative measurable function from rm n to   which  maps observable uncertainties        m  to choices of pricing policies we write the non   anticipativity constraints explicitly as  zm   ∀   om    where om is the projection operator which maps  to the portion of uncertain parameters that are  observable at the beginning of macro period m ie µm   we require that only one candidate  strategy be chosen during each macro period ie      for all  ∈ rm n   the price selected by the seller at time t ∈ t is then expressible as        pt− dt−    t zm ∀t ∈ tm m ∈ m  where t  t∈k we remark that the choice of candidate strategy at macro period m ∈   is adaptive whereas the choice of candidate strategy at macro period m   is a constant  we now provide two examples of candidate strategies  example  constant pricing strategy a natural choice for the candidate pricing strate   gies is to let t   for some  ∈ l u and for all t ∈ t  constant strategies have the drawback  that they do not favor exploration of the demand curve a whole instead they yield signiﬁcant  information on a speciﬁc point of the demand function in terms of uncertainty set for the demand  curve parameters entering the same price  during multiple micro periods progressively reduces  the set of estimates to a line segment in   space with the slope of the line depending on the  chosen value  a signiﬁcant advantage of constant strategies is that price adjustments become  infrequent they occur at most at the beginning of each macro period thus moderating possible  customer discontent they are commonly employed by retailers who periodically perform discounts  and must choose the best discount level to optimally balance exploration and exploitation eg   discount from full price versus  discount from full price  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  example  randomized pricing strategy another possibility is to allow the seller to  choose among randomized pricing strategies whereby for each  ∈ k t is chosen at random from  a strategy dependent interval i ⊂ l u prior to optimization such strategies have the beneﬁt  of promoting exploration of the uncertainty set for the parameters nevertheless they may elevate  customer discontent due to the high frequency of price adjustments randomized strategies are  particularly suited to cases when each customer cannot view the prices oﬀered to other customers  eg interest rate quotes online travel and hospitality bookings and online retail  remark  discrete prices in most realistic settings the admissible price set of the dynamic  pricing problem is discrete and ﬁnite the proposed solution approach lends itself particularly well  to this case in fact in section  we will investigate problems with discrete feasible price sets as  we believe that this is the type of problem of interest to practitioners  we are now ready to formulate a conservative approximation to dp following the proposed  reduction of the information space it reads  maximize inﬁmum pd∈u az   − max   −   b  −   subject to zm ∈   n  ∀m ∈ m  zm   ∀  ∈ rm n  om       ∀ ∈ rm n

time period aggregation corresponds to an adaptive  optimization problem with decision dependent uncertainty set which is solely aﬀected by binary  adaptive decision variables the coeﬃcients of the candidate strategies as we will typically be able  to choose m k  t and m n    the stage aggregation signiﬁcantly reduces both the number  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    of adaptive decision variables and the number of observable uncertain parameters in the problem  both of these reductions come at a moderate increase in the size of the representation of the  uncertainty set as we will see in the following section the proposed reduction in the information  space is crucial to achieve computational tractability  decision rule approximation the time period aggregation approximation enabled us to sub   stantially reduce the size of the dynamic pricing problem the aggregated problem adp is still  computationally intractable as it optimizes over binary adaptive functional decision variables  and possesses once expressed in epigraph form a continuum of constraints enforced over a policy   dependent set in this section we propose to approximate these adaptive decision variables by  functions that are piecewise constant over a preselected partition of the uncertainty set in the  spirit of vayanos et al  in section  we will propose several strategies for mitigating the  potential loss of optimality incurred from this approximation  remark  finite adaptability adaptive policies for classical two stage robust mixed inte   ger programs that do not necessitate a priori partitioning of the uncertainty set have been proposed  by bertsimas and caramanis  and hanasusanto et al  these papers investigate the  so called ﬁnite adaptability problem wherein the decision maker pre commits to a ﬁnite number  of second stage policies today and implements the best of these policies once the uncertain param   eters are revealed this type of policies oﬀers a great deal of ﬂexibility as the partitioning of the  uncertainty set is left to the optimization and can take on an arbitrary form on the other hand it  does not lend itself easily to our learning context where the uncertainty set is decision dependent  we believe that extending the ﬁnite adaptability approximation to mixed integer robust problems  with decision dependent uncertainty set is an interesting topic for future research  let    n     i   i ⊂ rm n denote any hyperrectangular set containing the projection of the  set   z∈ k u az onto the

ladp  is a mixed binary conic problem that is solvable with oﬀ the shelf solvers for  any ﬁxed number of subsets s for the partition its size remains polynomially bounded with the  number of macro

optimal solutions to problems with fewer subsets can be eﬃciently used  to warm start the solution to a problem with ﬁner granularity of the partition we will follow this  strategy in our numerical experiments see section    strategies for mitigating the loss of optimality  in the previous section we proposed to aggregate the periods in the problem and to subsequently  adaptively select at the beginning of each macro period one of ﬁnitely many candidate pricing  strategies rather than allowing the coeﬃcients of the candidate strategies to adapt to the entire  history of observations we restricted them to solely adapt to certain functions of the historical  price demand pairs that concisely summarize the historical information we then proposed to  approximate these adaptive coeﬃcients by functions that are piecewise constant over a preselected  partition of the set of observable uncertainties  on the one hand and as noted in section  the size of the resulting problem ladp  is  exponential in the number of macro periods if s is not ﬁxed this implies that it is desirable to  keep s small on the other hand keeping s small may result in a signiﬁcant loss of optimality  see the proof of proposition  and section  in this section we propose two strategies that enable  us to select partitions with small s while mitigating the loss of optimality of the approximation  to

natural way to mitigate the conservatism of the proposed approach at  moderate computational expense is to model the breakpoints used for the partition  as decision  variables of the problem then the uncertainty set  is not only allowed to depend on the  coeﬃcients of the candidate strategies on each subset but also on the breakpoints wi si  ∈ r i        m n s ∈ s in order to be able to

decision rule approximation scheme see section  we par   titioned the uncertainty set orthogonally to the axes of the observable uncertain parameters this  is restrictive and may result in large optimality gaps even for large values of s we thus naturally  propose to augment the vector of observable uncertainties by uncertainties that are expressible  as linear functions of  and to subsequently partition orthogonally the “lifted” uncertainty set  this is equivalent to partitioning the uncertainty set along arbitrary directions and adds more  ﬂexibility to the decision rule approximation   variants and extensions  in this section we discuss numerous variants and extensions to the basic model introduced in  section  to which our solution approach and modeling paradigm remain applicable   demand model variants  demand model with memory of past prices probably the most natural extension to the proposed  linear demand model is one where customers have memory of the past  prices whereby the demand  is expressible as dt         pt−   ∀t ∈ t  the solution approach presented in section   naturally extends to this demand curve variant  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    polynomial demand curve model as discussed in section  a linear demand curve model may  be inadequate if the feasible price range l u is large the proposed solution approach is applicable  to the case of polynomial demand curve models of degree d ∈ n of the form dt       p t   since p  t    t zm  t ◦  t ∈ tm is linear in zm m ∈ m  strategic customers a possible criticism of the model provided in section  is that it does not  account for the naturally strategic behavior of customers indeed in reality customers may be  willing to wait before purchasing a product in anticipation of a drop in price our framework  can naturally capture this behavior by allowing the demand to also depend on future prices ie  dt         pt   ∀t ∈ t  in this way we view customers as being able to anticipate  forecast in fact future price movements  time varying demand curve parameters finally our framework easily extends to the case of  a time varying demand curve where demand is expressible as dt  t  tpt   ∀t ∈ t  for  some parameters t ∈ r and t ∈ r that are unknown to the seller in this context the variabil   ity of the parameters may be restricted by eg bounding the p norm of the changes as follows   − t−∈t  ≤  and  − t−∈t  ≤  with     for the stage aggregation  approximation one would then employ weighted least squares estimates with weights decreasing  for data further in the past thus forgetting information   inventory management with pricing  newsboy problem with pricing and demand learning the simplest extension of the dynamic  pricing problem discussed in this paper is the newsboy problem with pricing in this variant the  capacity inventory c of the product is decided by the seller at the beginning of the planning  horizon a production cost cp ∈ r is incurred for each unit of the product ordered naturally the  solution approach proposed applies to this variant we remark that there is no need to encode c  in terms of binary variables as it does not aﬀect the uncertainty set  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  dynamic inventory management with pricing as discussed in section  it is generally beneﬁcial  for retailers to leverage on both sides of the proﬁt equation by simultaneously controlling inven   tories and prices to mitigate imbalances in supply and demand it is thus natural to ask whether  the proposed framework extends to the dynamic pricing problem with inventory management the  answer is positive we consider an extension of the inventory planning problem presented in bert   simas et al  that incorporates pricing decisions and demand learning and brieﬂy discuss  the steps involved in applying our approach  the model is as follows at the beginning of each stage t ∈ t  the retailer chooses the price  pt ∈ l u that will prevail during that period subsequently he faces the price sensitive demand dt  which is expressible in the form  the demand must be satisﬁed from the on hand inventory  xt ∈ r which may be replenished by placing orders ut ∈ r with a supplier at a cost r ∈ r per  unit we assume that ordering decisions take immediate eﬀect the inventory dynamics are thus  xt  xt−  ut − dt− ∀t ∈ t     for a given price demand path the proﬁt of the retailer is expressible as    t∈t  ptdt − rut − maxhxt −bxt  when the parameters of the demand model are unknown the ordering and inventory decisions also  the pricing decisions must be modeled as functions of the history of price demand observations  d  p t−    see section  we let t ∈ − and t ∈ − denote the inventory and  ordering policies respectively ie xt        pt− dt− and ut        pt− dt−  in the absence of distributional assumptions the set of possible realizations for the price demand  path is representable as in   in order to solve this variant of the pricing problem we proceed in three steps first we eliminate  the t variables using their expression which follows from  second we proceed with the stage   aggregation and decision rule approximations note that t does not need to be encoded in terms  of binary variables whereby m the

set the ﬁnal step consists in reformulating this  problem as a mixed binary conic problem which is achieved using the techniques from section    multi product pricing  network revenue management in this variant the seller oﬀers an array of i distinct products  and is endowed with a ﬁnite collection of resources r ∈ r       r each with ﬁxed ﬁnite  capacity cr that are used to produce or assemble the products at the beginning of each period  t ∈ t  the seller must choose prices pti ∈ l u for each product i in his product menu i       i  each unit of demand for product i consumes a quantity mri of resource r at the end of the  planning horizon the seller incurs holding or backlogging costs for each unit of under  or over   used resource r these are denoted by hr and br respectively collecting the costs into vectors  h  hrr∈r and b  brr∈r the proﬁt function of the seller for a given price sequence and  ensuing demand realization is expressible as              t pt − max    c − m

ability of the  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  decision maker to exploit information in this setting we model his pricing decisions as functions of  the historical observations related to all products thus the seller optimizes over a pricing policy         t  where each t t ∈ t  is a measurable function from − to l ui extend   ing the solution approach is simple we omit the derivation due to space limitations note that  the multi product pricing problem with ﬁnite inventories is a special case of the network revenue  management problem and can thus be accommodated by our modeling and solution paradigms   heuristic solution approaches  in this section we present dynamic pricing strategies commonly used in practice in section  we  will benchmark our proposed solution approach against these policies   certainty equivalent policies  the most common pricing strategies are the so called certainty equivalent or greedy iterated least   squares policies in this framework the retailer selects at each stage t ∈ t the price pt ∈ l u that  maximizes his proﬁt in the “nominal” realization of the uncertain parameters based on current  knowledge in our distribution free paradigm this corresponds to ﬁxing   to its least squares  estimate   calculated using the historical data d  p  ∈h and setting    for all t ∈ t  then  an optimal

program if  ≤  and to a mixed binary linear  program if the feasible price set is discrete   myopic policies  another class of policies employed in practice are so called myopic or static pricing strategies see  section  in this framework the seller updates his beliefs about the uncertain parameters and  subsequently implements the price that is optimal based on these beliefs iteratively at each stage  \fbertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted    contrary to certainty equivalent policies see section  these explicitly account for uncertainty  nevertheless they do not account for the fact that the seller will be able to adjust his future prices  based on the information dynamically acquired in the distribution free framework of this paper  an optimal myopic price  to charge in the ﬁrst stage can be computed by solving the robust    pt   − max  h  c −    pt     −b  c −    pt                t∈t    t∈t       ∈  h  dt    pt   ∀t ∈ h  ≤

employed in practice see section  on two synthetic data sets we begin by describing  the data sets under consideration and then address the following questions in turn  a how does the relative guaranteed performance of adaptive and myopic policies change as the  design parameters of the policies are varied  b what is the computational eﬀort solver time required to compute adaptive policies

proﬁts that can  be achieved by passing from myopic ie static robust policies to the proposed adaptive policies  in particular we investigate the impact of the adaptive policy design parameters selected by the  retailer on the learning gain second we compare the performance of a computed adaptive policy  and an optimal myopic policy out of sample  −−−−−−−−−\fbertsimas and vayanos data driven

parameters and the total  number of observable uncertainties is  −     as prices are discrete see table  we choose  to consider only constant candidate pricing strategies each equal to one of the six feasible prices  ie k   in other words at the beginning of each macro period we select one of six constant  pricing strategies see section   impact of policy design parameters on learning gain for the ﬁrst set of experiments we investi   gate the learning gain in dependence of the policy design parameters number of macro periods m  and breakpoint conﬁguration r        − for each m ∈       and for

solver time on figure  from the ﬁgures we observe that the learning gain  is negative  − when s   and m ≤  this is due to the stage aggregation indeed the  myopic strategy adjusts prices at each micro period t ∈ t  while the adaptive strategies adjust  their prices infrequently m  t times nevertheless with m as small as  ie by only adjusting  the pricing strategy three times within the planning horizon we observe that all the points on  the eﬃcient frontier achieve a non negative learning gain this implies that even by adjusting the  prices infrequently the seller can drastically increase his guaranteed proﬁts by learning the demand  curve in fact by adjusting the prices four times m   during the planning horizon the seller  can achieve a learning gain greater than  finally we observe that the maximal learning gain  achieved for s ≤  for m   is identical to the maximal learning gain achieved with m    indicating convergence of the stage aggregation approximation  \f  bertsimas and

for the second set of experiments we compare the empirical proﬁt  distributions associated with an optimal myopic policy and an optimal adaptive policy m   and  r                  for this purpose we compute a policy of each type and  draw  samples for   and  uniformly from the sets of parameters that are compatible with  the model and the historical data for each sample we implement each policy in turn and record  the proﬁt that the retailer would make by adjusting his prices as dictated by that policy the proﬁt  and loss distributions for these two policies and the distribution of the

performance of adaptive myopic and certainty equivalent policies  in this section we investigate the performance of our proposed adaptive policies relative to pricing  strategies commonly employed in practice see section  in a folding horizon setting on the instance  of the dynamic pricing problem dp  presented in section  we also compare each of these  approaches to a perfect information anticipative policy  \f  bertsimas and vayanos data driven learning in dynamic pricing article submitted  thus we draw  samples for   and  uniformly from the sets of parameters that are  compatible with the model and the historical data for each sample we compute the optimal  price sequencepolicy today but implement the “here and now” price  only subsequently we  observe the resulting price dependent demand faced by the retailer update the inventory and the  retailer’s beliefs about the demand curve parameters and decrement the length of the planning  horizon by one finally we re optimize and repeat this until the end of the planning horizon and  for each of myopic certainty equivalent and adaptive policies with design parameters m   and  r              and with  constructed as in the experiments from section  we  record the proﬁts earned for each sample and for each policy for each sample we also compute  and record the proﬁts that would be earned by a perfect information policy which knows at time  t   both the true demand curve parameters and the entire sequence of residual error realizations  we emphasize that this latter policy cannot be implemented in reality nevertheless it provides  an upper bound on the performance of any non anticipative pricing strategy the results are  summarized in table  and figure   from the table and the ﬁgures we observe that the adaptive policy outperforms both the cer   tainty equivalent and myopic policies in terms of all the reported statistics average and tail per   formance the most signiﬁcant improvements can
